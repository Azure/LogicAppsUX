  "description": "This workflow uses Azure Open AI connector to analyze the image content, and provides response to specific questions, based on that image.",
  "prerequisites": "To use this template, you need to configure an Azure Open AI instance an embedding model. Make sure the deployment model that you use supports image and vision requests. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2282600). ",
  "detailsDescription": "This workflow is based on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern, and analyzes the image content, and provides answers to specific questions, based on that image. The workflow performs this task by using the 'Get chat completions' action from the Azure OpenAI connector to interact with the OpenAI GPT-4 vision model. The template folder on GitHub includes two sample images and their respective sample questions (samplequestions.txt). To try the template using this sample, copy the image to a REST based location and use them with sample questions. Alternately, you can use your own image, and update the questions supplied to the 'Get chat completions' action in the template.",
