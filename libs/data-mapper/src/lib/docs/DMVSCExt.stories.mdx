# Data Mapper - VS Code Extension

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- `git clone`, and run `npm install` in, the logic_apps_designer repo
- Install nx if you haven't already - `npm install -g nx`

- .NET Core SDK 3.1 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1)
- Azure Functions Core Tools (https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools or `npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools --unsafe-perm true`)
- **VS Code Extensions:** Azure Tools, Azure Logic Apps (Standard)

- Logic Apps workflow (folder - w/ schemas) - see steps to create below:
  1.  In Azure Tools extension tab under Logic Apps (Standard), click the 'Create New Project' icon, and choose where you want the project folder
  2.  Open that folder in VS Code, then go back to Logic Apps (Standard), and click 'Create New Workflow' -> Stateless -> Press Enter
  3.  Make sure that ./Artifacts/Schemas exists within the project folder, and add an .xsd template schema for testing (ask the DM/LA team for some)

### Build

To build, run the following commands in order (from the root of the repo folder):

```bash
nx build vs-code-data-mapper
```

```bash
nx build vs-code-data-mapper-react
```

### Run

**NOTE:** If this is your first time running the Data Mapper extension, follow the backend setup instructions below

To run the VS Code extension (in debug mode):

1.  Open the repo folder in VS Code
2.  Click the 'Run and Debug' tab on the left (Activity) bar
3.  Select 'Run Data Mapper Extension...' in the dropdown at the top, then click the 'Start debugging' icon

### Backend Runtime Setup - \***\*ONLY for first time setup or new extension bundle version\*\***

1. Once the Data Mapper extension has been run, wait until you see that 'func host start' has acquired a lease in the output log.
   This is so that the necessary path/folder get generated for us to change out the runtime. Close the VS Code window running the Data Mapper extension once this is complete.
2. Download/Set-up the latest workflow extension bundle (https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_build?definitionId=160488&_a=summary)
   - Click the latest run -> Click on the 'artifacts' link under the 'build' stage -> Expand the '...Windows' dropdown -> Download the '...any-any.zip'
   - Go to yourRootUsernameFolder/.azure-functions-core-tools/Functions/ExtensionBundles/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows
   - Rename the current version folder (Ex: backup-1.1.16)
   - Replace it with the extracted folder you just downloaded (renaming it to the same version as the one you replaced)
3. You can now run the Data Mapper extension with its latest backend runtime!

## Usage / Supported Functionality

The extension will activate/initialize automatically upon viewing the Azure Tools extension tree, or by having a Logic Apps workflow folder (with a host.json) open in your VS Code workspace

Listed below are different ways you can kick off your usage/flow of Data Mapper:

- Context menu - load data map
- Azure Tools view - create new data map
- Within Data Mapper component - ConfigPane (choosing schemas) for existing schema files; save data maps to filesystem
