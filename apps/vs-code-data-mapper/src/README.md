# Azure Logic Apps - Data Mapper extension for Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, you can graphically describe transformations by mapping relationships between data types in a source schema and a target schema. After you install the Azure Logic Apps - Data Mapper extension, you can create direct basic relationships and more complex transformations using functions, handling any translation between supported schema types in the backend. For more information, see [Create maps to transform data in Azure Logic Apps with Visual Studio Code (preview)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2234193).
