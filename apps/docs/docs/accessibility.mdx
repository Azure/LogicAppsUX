# Accessibility

### Common issues

- Improper tab navigation
- Unclear focus states
- Focus traps / losing focus
- Non-descriptive screen reader support

## Best Practices

### Tab navigation

- Users should be able to navigate your application and perform all necessary actions through tab navigation
  - Sub-items accessible by arrow keys
  - Items offscreen when tabbed to will move the window to bring it on-screen
- Should be ordered logically, with tabIndex if needed
  - Remove items with `tabIndex={-1}`
	- Add items with `tabIndex={0}`
	- Tab indexes above 0 can be used to manually order elements, but it's not recommended
- Use header tags for longer blocks of content (h1, h2, h3)
  - Some screen readers let users jump between sections based off the header tags
- Focus traps
  - Some components like rich text fields may "trap" focus, not allowing a tab press to advance focus
  - If you are creating a "focus trap" make sure the user is able to escape out to continue navigation
  - Also check when entering / exiting submenus

### Focus indication

- Every element that can receive focus should have an apparent visual indication of focus
  - Most of the time this is done just by a contrasting border / outline
  - Test your state colors with a tool like https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
  - WCAG focus guidelines https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html

### Screen readers

- Users should be able to navigate your application with only the information read by screen readers
- Use proper html elements like `<button>`, `<ul>`, `<input>` when you can
	- Otherwise use the role property to categorize elements properly
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles
- Remember to translate all accessibility text
- Avoid using special characters, ex. "1 to 5" instead of "1-5"
- What screen readers verbalize
	- Normally screen readers will verbalize whatever the content of a focused item is
	- You can overwrite this with the ariaLabel prop, or the alt prop on img elements
	- There are plenty of other properties that get verbalized like ariaRequired

- Screen reader applications
	- JAWS - Windows application, widely used
		- https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS
	- VoiceOver - Mac application
		- https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac
	- ChromeVox - Browser extension (usually not recommended)

### Using prebuilt components

- If you use a prebuild / library component, don't assume that it will follow accessibility guidelines
  - Sometimes they just aren't compliant, or we use it in a way that messes with the accessibility
- Most fluent components are already compliant with WCAG guidelines

### Dialogues / Panels / Surfaces

- When new surfaces are rendered, be sure to test the focus and screen reader interactions
- Focus should be moved to the first element on the surface
- Screen readers should announce what happened when a surface opens / closes
	- ie. Announce that a dialogue opened, read the dialogue title, read the first element focused
- Decide on if the surface needs to trap focus, or if the user should be able to leave and access other elements

### Other tips

- Focus on conveying relevant information when writing components
	- There's no need to overload a component with 20 aria props
	- Most of the time just the content/label and the role is enough
- Remember to alert screen readers when new important information is available
	- ie. Dialogues opening, error messages
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role
