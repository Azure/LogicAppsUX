### Providing your workflow

If you are experiencing issues with a specific workflow, please provide the workflow definition if you are able. We understand that some workflows may contain sensitive information, so please remove any sensitive information before providing the workflow definition. If you are unable to provide the workflow definition, please provide a description or screenshots of the workflow and any important actions or connectors you think may be causing the issue.

### Collecting console errors

Providing console errors are very helpful for our engineers to quickly pinpoint the source of an issue. To collect console errors, please follow the steps below:

1. Open the developer tools in your browser with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I (Win)` or `Cmd+Opt+I (Mac)`
2. Select the **Console** tab
3. If you see any errors, you can right-click on the error and select **Save as...** to save the error to a text file
4. Otherwise you can also copy/paste as needed

### Collecting network logs in a HAR file

If you are experiencing issues with the designer loading, or with any network requests, collecting a HAR file will help us investigate the issue. To collect a HAR file, please follow the steps below:

1. Open the developer tools in your browser with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I (Win)` or `Cmd+Opt+I (Mac)`
2. Select the **Network** tab
3. Refresh the page and reproduce the issue
4. Once you have reproduced the issue, right-click anywhere in the grid of network requests, select **Save as HAR with Content**, and save the file to your computer
5. Your HAR file is now ready to be sent
6. If you want to sanitize the HAR file before sending, follow these steps: 
    1. Upload the HAR file to the [sanitizer tool](https://aka.ms/sanitizer) to remove any sensitive information
    2. Download the sanitized zip file
    3. Upload the *.sanitized.zip file to the incident/issue as an attachment

:::caution Warning on sensitive information

These network logs may contain sensitive information, so please do not share them within GitHub issues. If an engineer requests them, please send them via email. (Should be supplied when requesting the HAR)

### Finding your session ID or portal extension version

To get your session ID or currently active portal version follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a workflow
2. Open the Azure monitoring tools with `Ctrl+Alt+D (Win)` or `Ctrl+Opt+D (Mac)`
3. In the bottom right of the designer there should be a yellow box
4. You will find your **session ID** near the top of the list next to `Session ID:`
5. To get your **portal extension version** find the line `Loaded extensions: #` and click on `Details`
6. You will find your version next to the line that says `Microsoft_Azure_EMA:`
