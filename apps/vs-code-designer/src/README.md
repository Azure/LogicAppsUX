## Logic apps (standard) to resources tab

🎉 Version 2.15.15 and bigger: Logic apps standard extension now follows the desing pattern that the rest of the azure extensions are following; this implies removing our extension tab and move the remote logic apps tree structure into the resources tab in the azure panel. You will be able to see your remote apps when opening the Logic App dropdown. This also applies to the ribbon buttons that we used to have in our tab title, those were migrated to the workspace tab.
