## Azure Logic Apps (Standard) moves to the Resources tab

ðŸŽ‰ Version 2.15.15 and later: The Azure Logic Apps extension now follows the design pattern that Azure extensions follow. Previously, in the Azure window, an Azure Logic Apps extension section showed your Azure subscriptions and associated "remote" logic apps hosted in Azure.

Now, your remote logic apps still appear in the Azure window, but in the Resources section instead. You can see your remote logic apps when you expand the Logic App node.

Extension toolbar buttons have now migrated to the Workspace section.
