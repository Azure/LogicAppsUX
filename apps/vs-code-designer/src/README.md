## Azure Logic Apps - Data Mapper for Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, you can graphically describe transformations by mapping relationships between data types in a source schema and a target schema. After you install the Azure Logic Apps - Data Mapper, you can create direct basic relationships and more complex transformations using functions, handling any translation between supported schema types in the backend. For more information, see [Create maps to transform data in Azure Logic Apps with Visual Studio Code (preview)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2234193).

## Azure Logic Apps (Standard) moves to the Resources tab

🎉 Version 2.15.15 and later: The Azure Logic Apps extension now follows the design pattern that Azure extensions follow. Previously, in the Azure window, an Azure Logic Apps extension section showed your Azure subscriptions and associated "remote" logic apps hosted in Azure.

Now, your remote logic apps still appear in the Azure window, but in the Resources section instead. You can see your remote logic apps when you expand the Logic App node.

Extension toolbar buttons have now migrated to the Workspace section.

## Azure Logic Apps (Standard) Custom Code Workspace

We are excited to announce a new feature in Logic Apps that allows users to author their own custom code using the .NET Framework. With this new feature, users can create custom code actions that can be used in their Logic Apps workflows.

Please note that this feature is currently in private preview and is only available on Windows. We encourage users to try out this new feature and provide feedback to help us improve it.
